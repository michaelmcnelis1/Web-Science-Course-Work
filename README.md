To collect the tweets, run the file "web_get_data_exp.py"
This will create a file called "all_data.csv"
It should be noted that this code took approximately two hours run and collect the original data. As this is not feasible to run while marking, the number of tweets fetched can be reduced by editing lines 70 and 105 to say .items(100) instead of .items(1500).


To clean the data, run the file "web_test_test.py"
